# java_game
A rpg-like game in java.

this is a personal proyect that aims creating an rpg game, i'm not planning on creating a visual interface, not because i don't want to but because i don't know how.

Feel free to send your ideas and if I find interesting your ideas I'll feature you!

The main idea is to have a character with items, and you start by selecting a name and a class, your character level up when fighting and winning and you can obtain objects when completing challenges or defeating bosses, I want to create a story mode and a multiplayer mode when you can fight.

I have a lot of ideas but currently i'm really far of achieving something remotely cool and I don't want to use templates since I want to experience the full process.

Thank you so much for reading this to the end!
